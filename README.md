# Hi there!👋 I'm Marly 



**Welcome to my GitHub profile ✨**.
- 🚀 After three years working as a **Mechanical Engineer** in the heavy machinery industry, motivated by various factors, including the desire to express my creativity in my work activities, I decided to redirect my career towards **Frontend Development**.

- 👩‍💻 I have been working on several personal projects involving **CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS**, which you can explore here on my GitHub profile.
